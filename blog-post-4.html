        </div>

        <div class="blog-main-intro-text">
            <p>Self-discipline plays a very large role when it comes to building success for yourself. You have to
                keep yourself disciplined and if you are like most people, you will be a constant fight with your
                weaker self who is not ready for all the good changes you are making. The thing is though, if
                you stay with it, you will eventually win this battle and the new you will shine through nice and
                bright. Here are some keys I've done my best to follow that I believe can help you become a more 
                disciplined person, thus resulting in hitting your goals faster.</p>

                <p>Cut Out The Excuses</p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-point-desc">
                <p>We all have them. Excuses are amongst the deadliest plague when it comes to building
                    success. If you don’t want to do something or you do want to do something, you will
                    almost always be able to make an excuse of why you shouldn’t or of why you should do
                    it. Like I said, we all have them. Or at least, could easily come up with one on the spot
                    for almost any area in our lives. However, the most successful people don’t let their
                    excuses come to light, or hold them back from accomplishing big things in this life.
                    Remember that the excuses you make are not some special case. You can make an
                    excuse up for anything, they aren’t rare. Learn that it is something that is never there to
                    help you, and only to hold you back.

                <p>Embrace the change of becoming a new and better person.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-point-desc">
                <p>In order to do achieve something you’ve never achieved before, you must do what
                    you’ve never done before. One of the biggest problems I see with people trying to
                    achieve big things but are having trouble, is that people are unwilling to change who
                    they are, in order to become better and achieve their goals. Don’t be afraid of change,
                    it’s necessary. If everything stayed the same, how would there be a change in results
                    and where would your success come from? Embrace the change.
                </p>

        <div class="blog-main-point">
            <div class="blog-point-title">
                <p>Remember that you are bound to catch success if you do what the most
                    successful people do..</p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-point-desc">
                <p>
                    If you follow in the steps of the most successful people, what could stop you from being
                    successful? Of course, in some ways your path will be much different than someone
                    who did it previously in a different situation, but in other ways it will be very similar. If
                    you want to become a doctor, you will probably face a lot of the same problems a
                    previous doctor did while they were coming up. If you want to be an entrepreneur, you
                    will likely go through a lot of the same steps and phases an entrepreneur in your field
                    went through previously. If you follow the advice and take the knowledge that’s
                    available on how to become successful in your target industry, there’s nothing that can
                    stop you from eventually reaching that success.

            <div class="blog-point-title">
                <p>Whatever your mind and actions are focused on, is what will
                    grow in your life.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="blog-point-desc">
                <p>It’s impossible to be focused and dedicated to something, and not reach some success
                    in it. People don’t believe this because it’s hard for us to put in the focus and dedication
                    that’s necessary to reach large success. Think of your favorite movies about characters
                    reaching tough goals and everything they went through to achieve their success. I know
                    they’re movies, but could you even imagine them not achieving their goals, or at least
                    hitting a star while they aimed for the moon? Probably not. Because in movies we see
                    characters that are written in to be so focused on the plot and the story that nothing
                    will stop them from resolving the extreme climax. Picture yourself in a movie and let the
                    completion of your goals be the climaxes that you have to resolve. </p>

            <div class="blog-point-desc">
                <p>Happiness comes when negative emotions are not present. Happiness doesn’t come
                    from the focus on trying to be happy, it just arises naturally when there are no negative
                    thoughts and emotions for your mind to attach itself to. Remove all the negative
                    thoughts and doubts that are gnawing at your success and let the feelings of relief, joy,
                    happiness, and success take over and carry you to the fantasy where all your goals are
                    achieved, except it will be real life.

            <div class="blog-point-desc">
                <p>We’ve all heard things like “success doesn’t happen overnight” and “Rome wasn’t built
                    in a day” but people tend to not understand this. Many people still believe in overnight
                    success because the media hypes people up to be overnight successors. A music artist
                    may get signed and drop a hit song, and the media will start covering that person and
                    making them out to be a overnight success, but that overnight success probably came
                    after hours and hours of music writing, studio sessions, failed songs and projects, etc.
                    Hardly anyone gets it right the first time, but people who work towards their goals
                    everyday tend to get it right eventually and they tend to have more luck.</p>

            <div class="blog-point-desc">
                <p>“To live is to learn” is a quote I have read somewhere and I definitely made it a part of
                    my lifestyle. Learning and living go hand in hand. Learn from experiences, books, videos,
                    music, people, etc. There’s so much to learn out there at every moment and it’s
                    something that should be taken advantage of. The more you learn, the more advantages
                    you have over people who stay stagnant and fall behind. Don’t fall into the wave of
                    mediocrity where you want nothing more than to be entertained by non-cognitive
                    activities all day. Work your brain, learn more, take action, and count the money that
                    comes along with it all.</p>
